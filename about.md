Hi, I'm Cayden.

I'm an organizer, technologist, and all-purpose nerd living on unceded Ohlone land (Oakland, California). I like to say I was raised by the internet, and some of its pro-social sensibilities are central to the way that I think about its latent potential. I'm very interested in the shifting boundaries of community and group identity online, and the ways that the design of technology impacts how we understand ourselves and one another.

Lately I've been thinking a lot about the surveillance economy, but also the ways in which the surveillance economy is an economy of affect. I'm working on a manuscript to help organizers better understand the affect economy and how affect shapes power on the internet.

My most recent day job was as Executive Director of [18 Million Rising](http://18mr.org), the digital-first anchor of national progressive Asian American organizing. My previous roles at 18MR have included Chief Technology Officer, New Media Director, and Social Media Organizer. I'm proud to say that I'm responsible for introducing lightweight, modular tech stacks into digital-first organizing and for [VoterVOX](https://votervox.org), an experiment in how tech designed by communities can transform workflows that already exist in those communities into important tools for change.

Previous day jobs include: teaching media theory and game design to undergraduates; bartending at a vegetarian restaurant; organizing university workers for a labor union; driving a delivery route; designing websites for local businesses; and various forms of retail.

Work that I've done that I don't get paid for includes organizing with the [Save E. 12th Coalition](http://proposal.e12thoak.land), which brought neighbors together to design and propose a plan for a parcel of public land in my current neighborhood in Oakland, California; cofounding [Youngist](http://youngist.org), a youth media collective that we closed in 2016 that published fearless reporting and commentary from youth movements around the world; working with the movement tech community on issues of equity and gender-based violence in our work and organizing spaces; helping organize the [Allied Media Conference](https://alliedmedia.org/amc); and writing about all the ideas you will find on this website.

### About This Site

This site is built using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com), a static site generator written in Ruby. It's hosted on GitHub Pages. If something is busted, [let me know here](https://github.com/catachresis/bwo/issues).

The theme is [Moon](https://github.com/TaylanTatli/Moon) by Taylan Tatli. The background image is graffiti from the May '68 uprising in Paris. The graffiti reads "_sous les paves, la plage!_" or "beneath the paving stones, the beach!" The words are both literal (the paving stones of Paris were laid upon sand, which the rebels discovered when they pulled them up to use during the uprising), but can also be read as a rallying cry to dismantle the subjugating logic of capitalism to discover joy, play, and freedom beneath.
