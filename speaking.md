## Book Me

Want to invite me to speak on your campus or in your community?

I can talk about current and previous [work](/cv/), technology and organizing, and lessons from a decade of organizing online. I'm also happy to speak to the specific principles and values motivating millennial Asian American organizing; abolition; and building a multiracial democracy.

I am happy to negotiate on honoraria, especially with student groups and grassroots organizers.

Get the process started by [introducing yourself](mailto:catachresis@protonmail.com&subject=Booking a speaking engagement): who you are, where your event is, and why you're interested in hosting me.
